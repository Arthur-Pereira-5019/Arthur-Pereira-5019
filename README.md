Other Skills:
 - 👂Leadership: Almost every year of both high and elementary school I was part of a club or group, such as dance, drama, social studies, writers, so in all those clubs and also by the many times I was the class leader, I learned how to work together with people that had different views and different interests, and how to respectfully show my opinions without going against the hierarchy.
- 🧠Loving to Learn: I really like to learn new stuff, and when I'm not programming with my spare time, I'm learning and using it to create stuff.
- ⏲️Time management: During my high school I had to put together a lot of stuff, yet I always found a way to never deliver something later than it should be.
